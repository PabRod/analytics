## Title
_Complex numbers for research software engineers_

##  Abstract
If you are reading this, most likely you are working on a computer-science related field.
Why would you care about the square root of minus one (also known as i)? Let me give you a few reasons:

The mysterious number i:

* is the NaN of the Renaissance.
* appears in the Euler's identity, acclaimed as the most beautiful equation ever.
* allowed for difficult computations in aerodynamics before the computer was invented.
* can improve your numerical differentiation algorithms with minimal effort.
